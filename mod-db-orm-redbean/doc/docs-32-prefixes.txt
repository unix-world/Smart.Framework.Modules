Prefixes

In RedBeanPHP, the underscore '_' is used to denote a relation between two tables. For instance a table 'book_tag' is used to associate books with tags.
So, if you want to use table prefixes like 'cms_' or 'tbl_' you'll have to bypass the RedBeanPHP schema policy check like this:
    R::ext('xdispense', function( $type ){
        return R::getRedBean()->dispense( $type );
    });

Now you can use an underscore in your bean type:
    $page = R::xdispense( 'cms_page' );

However, the name of the type still looks odd. Using a constant, you can improve the readability of this code:
    define( 'PAGE', 'cms_page' );
    $page = R::xdispense( PAGE );

This also works for relations:
    define( 'PAGES', 'ownCms_page' );
    $pages = $site->{PAGES};

Here is a complete example:
    //Define your mappings like this
    define( 'POEM', 'tbl_poem' );
    define( 'BOOK', 'tbl_book' );
    define( 'AUTHOR', 'tbl_author' );
    define( 'CATEGORY', 'tbl_category' );
    define( 'POEMS', 'ownTblPoem' );
    define( 'CATEGORIES', 'sharedTblCategory' );

    //Create an extension to by-pass security check in R::dispense
    R::ext('xdispense', function( $type ){
        return R::getRedBean()->dispense( $type );
    });

    //Use tbl_book_category instead of tbl_book_tbl_category
    R::renameAssociation([
        'tbl_book_tbl_category' => 'tbl_book_category'
    ]);

    //Use them like this:
    $poem = R::xdispense( POEM );
    $poem->title = 'Trees';
    $author = R::xdispense( AUTHOR );
    $author->name = 'Joyce Kilmer';
    $book = R::xdispense( BOOK );
    $book->title = 'Trees and other poems';
    $category = R::xdispense( CATEGORY );
    $category->name = 'nature';
    $book->{AUTHOR} = $author;
    $book->{POEMS}[] = $poem;
    $book->{CATEGORIES}[] = $category;
    $id = R::store( $book );

    //For testing purposes let's output something:
    $book = R::load( BOOK, $id );
    $poem = reset( $book->{POEMS} );
    $author = $book->{AUTHOR};
    $category = reset( $book->{CATEGORIES} );

    echo "Have you ever read '{$poem->title}' ({$book->title}) by {$author->name} ?
    it's a beautiful poem about {$category->name}.";

This code will output:
Have you ever read 'Trees' (Trees and other poems) by Joyce Kilmer ? it's a beautiful poem about nature.

Use the R::renameAssociation method to select a proper name for the association table.

Note that using table prefixes can be quite dangerous, especially if you use them to avoid having to create multiple databases: mixing data from multiple clients in one database can cause serious security issues !

Another way to map tables is to use VIEWS of course. This is an even simpler approach but it might affect performance.
Using multiple schemas

If you use Postgres you can devide your databases in multiple 'schemas'. Simply tell RedBeanPHP where to look for its beans using the 'search path':
    R::exec( 'SET search_path TO crm' ); //use RedBeanPHP for the CRM module
