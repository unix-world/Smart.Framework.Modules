RedBeanPHP 4 Additional Plugin Pack

As of RedBeanPHP 4, the core package has been trimmed down. Some less essential components have been moved to this plugin package during the clean-up. The plugin package contains the following components:

    Support for CUBRID database for RedBeanPHP 4
    BeanCan Server Version 1 and 2 for RedBeanPHP 4
    Preloader (for eager loading features) for RedBeanPHP 4
    SQLHelper, a Query Builder for RedBeanPHP 4
    Old Cooker component for RedBeanPHP 4

Download the additional plugin pack for RedBeanPHP4.

Note that some of these plugins are considered deprecated. The Cooker and the Preloader have been replaced in RedBeanPHP 4 by different mechanisms. The SQLHelper is also considered deprecated. The CUBRID QueryWriter and the BeanCan Servers are still fully supported.
