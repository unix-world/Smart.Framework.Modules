			and the new read_asdata() since version 1.5 is now behaving like the old read_adata() in versions prior to 1.5;
			- the new read_adata() since version 1.5: Read Associative Multiple Rows :: returns array(0 => array('column1', 'column2', ... 'column-n'), 1 => array('column1', 'column2', ... 'column-n'), ..., m => array('column1', 'column2', ... 'column-n'))
			- the new read_asdata() since version 1.5: Read Associative Single (one) Rows :: Throws Error if more records are returned by SQL :: returns a single row as array('column1', 'column2', ... 'column-n')
			(this come as a result from many users of these framework to make this function names more easy to remember)
			thus, this will remain finally as it is now since version 1.5
