QuickMockup is a simple tool for creating simple mockups of interfaces and websites. It is HTML based and javascript-enhanced.

I currently don't develop this. If you need something more powerful, have a look at https://github.com/jgraph/draw.io

## Usecase

The tool is meant to allow to *quickly* create mockups of interfaces in order to *communicate* ideas.

It is *not* meant for pixel perfect mockups nor for complex interface mockups involving several screens and hundereds of elements. 

The target group for now are interaction/interface *designers* or design-aware *developers* who take part in open source projects and need to communicate their ideas. An mockup is worth a thousand words in this case.

### Saving

You can just save the webpage with your browsers save function (e.g. see [here for Firefox](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/how-save-web-page)) . In the dropdown in the saving dialog, you can select something like »complete webpage« and »only HTML«. 

* If you save the »complete webpage« , you retain interactivity (you could zip the files, send it to someone and that person could just continue working) . 
* If you save »only HTML«, you still save a file containing your mockup wich you can view in any browser.
 
You can also just do a screenshot (in case it is more a throw-away mock anyway) using whichever tool you like.

## Technology/Implementation

HTML based and javascript-enhanced, means that the functions rely on manipulating the HTML directly; there is no MVC-Framework, Database etc. The core code is not very long.

This has the advantage of keeping things simple. It means also that I needed to go with what works well already. E.g. there in no zoom, since it makes dragging much harder to manage.

## Create own interface Elements

Interface elements (a custom button or so) can be created in HTML and CSS.

See the source code for now, there are instructions in a comment in the html at the beginning of the code for the element list.
