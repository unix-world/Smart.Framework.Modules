/**
 * Helper object to serve as glue between pool & item.
 *
 * New items are created by first get()-ing them from the pool. It would be
 * inefficient to let such a get() immediately query the real cache (because it
 * may not be meant to retrieve real data, but just to set a new value)
 *
 * Instead, every Item returned by get() will be a "placeholder", and once the
 * values are actually needed, this object will be called to go do that (along
 * with every other value that has not yet been resolved, while we're at it)
